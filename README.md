# 🗣️ JARVIS - Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant  

Jarvis is a Python-based voice-activated virtual assistant designed to make daily tasks easier through voice commands. It can browse the web, play music, fetch news, and answer complex queries using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. Think of it as your personal desktop assistant, similar to Alexa or Google Assistant!
